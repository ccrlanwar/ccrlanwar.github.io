I’d rather have $150.000 that is illegal. Simply because of the amount of the dollars, you could pay back $50.000 for saying it’s legal, so that only $10.000 that could be saved in your pocket which has more value than true legal amount. Buy legal dollars for only $50.000, and you save $10.000. No, I’m kidding you.
