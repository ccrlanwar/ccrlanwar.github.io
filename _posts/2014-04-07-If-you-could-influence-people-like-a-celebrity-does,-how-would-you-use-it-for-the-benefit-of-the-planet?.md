Truth to be told that we are part of world society. No matter wherever we stay in, people have the same rights. Like other people stay in this planet, and all creatures actually have the same rights too as human. So based on that universal rights, we could summarize that all we need is to save each others, respect, interact, and being together in solving the problems, making decision whatâ€™s the next vision we have to have is the major point to get the better world, life, and love.
