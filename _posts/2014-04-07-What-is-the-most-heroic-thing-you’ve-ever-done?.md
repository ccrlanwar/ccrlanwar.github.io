I’d like to say, last night was non-heroic thing since I could sell my friend’s DVD player only Rp100.000 to unknown man from the original price which was about Rp300.000, just because he didn’t have money plan for the next day in addition of his pregnant wife, and still have no idea what to make them feel save after Rp100.000 ends. That's it.
