The reality is we have limited visual space in this such small earth, and brain to observe that such wide galaxy. Asking what’s life look like on other planets doesn’t mean the same thing like we life in earth. We could see the differences of the particular lives in earth, coming from microscopic to eye capturing lives. On other planets, they (human) try to serve different image as usually we know in earth, called Alien or whatever it is with random life. Yes, our technical -dream- observer just present us like such weird face, not my avatar.
